# The Modern Hypatia
> A blog about women in science, and science about women

We are The Modern Hypatia, three unorthodox biomedical scientists with three very different stories to tell on the journey beyond academia. Even if we have chosen very different paths, there is something we still have in common: we are women in STEM.

This website offers the bloging experience of us three contributors talking about science, scientific careers and above all women in science.
